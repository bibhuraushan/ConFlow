Developer tasks for ConFlow

 - Use zm_parse.f to add command line option parsing
 - Add input flags for total time, cadence, etc.
 - Add input flags for using fixed seed or random seed.

 - Add output of text file with list of output files and their times and seq numbers
   (similar to hipft).

 - Add scripts to automatically plot velocities, clean up a run, etc.

 - Add options for resolution:
   - output resolution nt x np
   - type of grid (current AFT-style or PSI-style)

 - Go through code and make it conform to decided on style guide
 - Go through code an document with references what each part is doing.

 - Re-factor code into a "driver code" and a linked "core code".
   The driver code should call the core code routines to setup, and run the algorithm,
   and then have the I/O.
   This way, we can have HipFT "drive" the code by linking to the "core code" setup and advance routines.

 - See if parts of the code (like plm) can be replaced with more
   modern versions (similar to the tesserial spherical harmonic code)
   for robustness and speed.
 - See if Fourier transform is (or can be replaced with) FFT?

 - Profile code run and check for hot spots.

 - Once code is re-factored and understood, see if it is straight forward
   to utilize standard parallelism + OpenACC/MP to parallelize the code.
